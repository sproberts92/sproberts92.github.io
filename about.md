I am a part way through my master's in theoretical physics. I have created this blog for two reasons:

* to practice writing about topics related to science and programming
* to learn more about HTML and CSS

As I work on the second point I intend to gradually improve the appearance of the site beyond the default Jekyll theme.

Hopefully you learn something interesting from the posts here. Thank you for visiting.
